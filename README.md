ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm **Dina Graves Portman**

I'm a Developer Relations Engineer at Google, where I spend my time
working on CI/CD tools and automating metrics collection ðŸ¤– (_like [Four Keys](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys)_).

Outside of work, I play the piano, lift weights, and eat donuts.
